"""
Client side: use sockets to send data to the server, and print server's
reply to each message line; 'localhost' means that the server is running
on the same machine as the client, which lets us test client and server
on one machine;  to test over the Internet, run a server on a remote
machine, and set serverHost or argv[1] to machine's domain name or IP addr;
Python sockets are a portable BSD socket interface, with object methods
for the standard socket calls available in the system's C library;
